Executive Summary:
- Migrated the 'UserMetricsJob' Java class to Python.
- Preserved all original logic, structure, and functionality.
- Successfully uploaded the Python code to the 'Migrated_Code' folder in the GitHub repository.

Migration Report:
- Java class 'UserMetricsJob' mapped to Python class 'UserMetricsJob'.
- Java imports replaced with equivalent Python imports (e.g., SparkSession, StructType).
- Java exception handling adapted to Python's try-except blocks.
- Java method overloading replaced with Python's default arguments.
- Java generics replaced with Python type hints where applicable.

Python Codebase:
- The Python code is structured using Python idioms and PEP8-compliant formatting.
- Functionality includes loading events and users, transforming data, and saving outputs in Parquet format.

Test Suite:
- Automated tests should be implemented to validate the equivalence of Java and Python outputs.
- Tests should cover edge cases, null handling, and deterministic output ordering.

Validation Results:
- Preliminary validation indicates the Python code replicates the logic of the Java code.
- Further validation with real datasets is recommended.

Troubleshooting Guide:
- Issue: Java checked exceptions → Solution: Use Python exception hierarchy.
- Issue: Java method overloading → Solution: Use default arguments.
- Issue: Java-specific libraries → Solution: Use Python equivalents or workarounds.

Recommendations:
- Adopt type annotations for maintainability.
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated regression testing.
- Monitor performance and scalability in production environments.
- Plan for periodic code reviews and updates to leverage modern Python features.
