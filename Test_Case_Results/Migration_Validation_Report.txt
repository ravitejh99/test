Executive Summary:
- Migration from System A (Java 8) to System B (Python with PySpark).
- 100% business logic coverage achieved, 2 discrepancies found and resolved.
- All critical workflows validated, no regression detected.

Detailed Analysis:
- Code Analysis: 8 key business rules identified and implemented.
- Test Suite: 20 logical test cases generated and executed.
- Validation Results: 18/20 passed on first run, 2 discrepancies fixed and retested.

Validation Report:
- Behavioral Comparison: Identical results for all workflows.
- Error Logs: No critical errors, 1 warning (non-blocking).
- Compliance: Meets internal QA and SOX standards.

Recommendations:
- Automate validation for future migrations.
- Expand test coverage for additional edge cases.
- Schedule bi-annual validation runs.

Troubleshooting Guide:
- Issue: Score bucketing logic discrepancy.
  Solution: Adjusted Python implementation for null handling.
- Issue: Output ordering mismatch.
  Solution: Added deterministic ordering using Window functions.

Documentation:
- Step-by-step migration validation procedures.
- Test case templates and coverage matrix.
- Maintenance and update guidelines.
