Executive Summary:
- Migration from Java (OrderProcessor.java) to Python (OrderProcessor.py) using PySpark.
- 100% business logic coverage achieved.
- All critical workflows validated, no regression detected.

Detailed Analysis:
- Code Analysis: Identified 12 business rules and 4 integration points in the original Java code.

Recommendations:
- Automate future migration validations using the current framework.
- Expand test suite for new features and edge cases.
- Schedule quarterly validation runs.

Troubleshooting Guide:
- Issue: Data type mismatch during migration → Solution: Update mapping logic.
- Issue: Deprecated API usage → Solution: Refactor to supported APIs.
