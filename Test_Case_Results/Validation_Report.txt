Validation Report:

Discrepancy Identified:
- The migrated Python file 'UserMetricsJob.py' is incomplete and only contains placeholder content.
- Missing implementation for SparkSession setup, data loading, transformations, and output generation.

Recommendations:
- Complete the migration by implementing the missing logic from the Java codebase.
- Ensure preservation of business logic, workflows, and integration points.

Next Steps:
- Assign resources to complete the migration.
- Validate the completed Python implementation against the original Java codebase.
