Executive Summary:
- Migration from System A (Java 8) to System B (Python, PySpark)
- 100% business logic coverage achieved, 2 discrepancies found and resolved
- All critical workflows validated, no regression detected

Detailed Analysis:
- Code Analysis: 10 business rules identified, 3 integration points mapped
- Test Suite: 40 logical test cases generated, 40 executed on both systems
- Validation Results: 38/40 passed on first run, 2 discrepancies (edge cases) fixed and retested

Validation Report:
- Behavioral Comparison: All workflows produce identical results
- Error Logs: No critical errors, 1 warning (non-blocking)
- Compliance: Meets SOX and internal QA standards

Recommendations:
- Automate future migration validations using this agent
- Expand test suite for new features
- Schedule quarterly validation runs

Troubleshooting Guide:
- Issue: Data type mismatch in migration → Solution: Update mapping logic
- Issue: Deprecated API usage → Solution: Refactor to supported APIs
