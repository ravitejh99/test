Executive Summary:
- Migrated the UserMetricsJob class from Java to Python.
- Preserved all logic, structure, and functionality.
- Ensured compatibility with Python 3.11 and modern coding standards.

Migration Report:
- Java SparkSession mapped to PySpark Session.
- Java Dataset<Row> mapped to PySpark DataFrame.
- Java methods adapted to Python functions.
- Exception handling converted to Python's try-except blocks.

Challenges and Solutions:
- Java checked exceptions: Used Python exception hierarchy.
- Java method overloading: Used default arguments in Python.
- Java generics: Replaced with Python type hints.

Recommendations:
- Adopt type annotations for maintainability.
- Integrate with CI/CD for automated regression testing.
