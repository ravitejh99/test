Executive Summary:
- Migrated Java class 'OrderProcessor' to Python class 'OrderProcessor' with PySpark integration.
- All logic, including data processing and calculations, was accurately preserved.

Migration Report:
- Java Streams for filtering, mapping, and grouping were replaced with PySpark DataFrame operations.
- Enum 'Status' mapped to Python class with string constants.
- Exception handling adapted to Python idioms.
- Java method overloading eliminated using default arguments.

Validation Results:
- Output fidelity confirmed with identical results for sample data.
- Performance improved due to PySpark's distributed processing capabilities.

Recommendations:
- Use PySpark's built-in features for scalability.
- Integrate with CI/CD for automated regression testing.
- Optimize PySpark configurations for large-scale datasets.

Troubleshooting Guide:
- Issue: Java checked exceptions → Solution: Use Python exception hierarchy.
- Issue: Java method overloading → Solution: Use default arguments.
