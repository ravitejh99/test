Step-by-Step Migration Validation Procedures:
1. Analyze original Java code to extract business logic and workflows.
2. Compare original Java code with migrated Python code to validate functional equivalence.
3. Generate test cases to validate each business logic and workflow.
4. Execute test cases on both original and migrated systems, comparing results for behavioral parity.
5. Document findings, recommendations, and test results.

Findings:
- All business logic and workflows were successfully preserved during migration.
- No discrepancies were found in the migrated code.

Recommendations:
- Implement automated validation for future migrations.
- Maintain a comprehensive test suite to cover all business scenarios.

Knowledge Transfer:
- Original Java code and migrated Python code are stored in the GitHub repository.
- Validation report and test case results are available in the 'Test_case_Results' directory.
- Documentation is available in the 'Code_Documents' directory.
