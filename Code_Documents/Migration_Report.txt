Executive Summary:
- Migrated Java class 'UserMetricsJob' (approximately 200 LOC) to Python 3.11.
- All business logic and functionality were preserved, including Spark transformations, logging, and exception handling.
- Python code adheres to PEP8 standards and uses modern Python idioms.

Migration Report:
- Java SparkSession configuration mapped to PySpark SparkSession.
- Java DataFrame operations translated to PySpark equivalents.
- Java UDF registration adapted to Python UDFs.
- Exception handling and logging converted to Python's logging module.
- Java generics replaced with Python type hints.
- Java Streams replaced with Python list comprehensions where applicable.

Validation Results:
- Outputs from Python code match those of the original Java implementation.
- Performance metrics are consistent with the original.

Troubleshooting Guide:
- Issue: Java checked exceptions → Solution: Use Python exception hierarchy.
- Issue: Java method overloading → Solution: Use default arguments or @overload decorator.

Recommendations:
- Adopt type annotations for maintainability.
- Integrate with CI/CD for automated regression testing.

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the migration process and outcomes, ensuring a seamless transition from Java to Python.
