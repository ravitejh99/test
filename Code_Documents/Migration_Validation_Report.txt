Executive Summary:
- Migrated the `UserMetricsJob` Java class to Python.
- All outputs validated with identical results to the original Java implementation.
- Comprehensive documentation and test results uploaded to GitHub.

Detailed Analysis:
- Java class `UserMetricsJob` mapped to Python class `UserMetricsJob`.
- Java Streams replaced with Python pandas operations.
- Exception handling adapted to Python idioms.
- Java method overloading replaced with Python default arguments.

Python Codebase:
Uploaded as `UserMetricsJob.py` in the `Migrated_Code` folder of the GitHub repository.

Test Suite:
Validation results uploaded as `ValidationResults.txt` in the `Test_Case_Results` folder of the GitHub repository.

Validation Results:
- All outputs match the original Java implementation.
- Test cases for edge cases and performance metrics passed successfully.

Troubleshooting Guide:
- Issue: Java checked exceptions → Solution: Use Python exception hierarchy.
- Issue: Java method overloading → Solution: Use default arguments or @staticmethod.

Recommendations:
- Adopt type annotations for maintainability.
- Integrate with CI/CD for automated regression testing.
- Test scalability with larger datasets.
